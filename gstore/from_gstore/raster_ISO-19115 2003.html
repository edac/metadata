                  This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture
                  Imagery Program (NAIP).  The NAIP program is administered by
                  USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA
                  strategic goals centered on agricultural production.
                  These are, increase stewardship of America's natural resources
                  while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities
                  are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to
                  increase food security.  The NAIP program supports these goals by
                  acquiring and providing orthoimagery that has been collected
                  during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP
                  orthoimagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a
                  fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation
                  programs.  Orthoimagery provides an effective, intuitive
                  means of communication about farm program administration
                  between FSA and stakeholders.
                  New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and
                  maintaining a relationship with vendors and government
                  partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial
                  community.  As a result of these efforts the NAIP program
                  provides three main products: DOQQ tiles,
                  Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files
                  The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed
                  over time reflecting agency requirements and improving
                  technologies.  These changes include image resolution,
                  horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands.
                  In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are
                  targeted for peak crop growing conditions.  The NAIP
                  acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year refresh of base
                  ortho imagery.  The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based
                  on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer
                  on all four sides.  NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM
                  coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983.
                  NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.
                  </span></dt>
            <dt>Purpose <span>
                  NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days
                  of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current
                  information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm
                  programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter and 1/2 meter
                  GSD product provides an orthoimage base for Common Land Unit
                  boundaries and other data sets.  The 1 meter and 1/2 meter NAIP
                  imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in
                  cooperation with state government and other federal agencies that
                  use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use
                  planning and natural resource assessment.  The NAIP is also used
                  for disaster response.  While suitable for a variety of uses,
                  prior to 2007 the 2 meter GSD NAIP imagery was primarily intended
                  to assess "crop condition and compliance" to USDA farm program
                  conditions. The 2 meter imagery was generally acquired only
                  for agricultural areas within state projects.

                        NAIP horizontal accuracy specifications have evolved over
                        the life of the program.  From 2003 to 2004 the
                        specifications were as follows: 1-meter GSD imagery was
                        to match within 3-meters, and 2-meter GSD to match within 10
                        meters of reference imagery.  For 2005 the 1-meter GSD
                        specification was changed to 5 meters matching the reference
                        imagery.  In 2006 a pilot project was performed using true
                        ground specifications rather than reference imagery.  All
                        states used the same specifications as 2005 except Utah,
                        which required a match of +/- 6 meters to true ground.
                        In 2007 all specifications were the same as 2006 except
                        Arizona used true ground specifications and all other states
                        used reference imagery.  In 2008 and subsequent years
                        no 2-meter GSD imagery was acquired and all specifications
                        were the same as 2007 except approximately half of the
                        states acquired used true ground specifications and the
                        other half used reference imagery.  The 2008 states that
                        used absolute ground control where; Indiana, Minnesota,
                        New Hampshire, North Carolina, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia.
                        From 2009 to present all NAIP imagery acquisitions used
                        the +/- 6 meters to ground specification.

                              The CCD arrays have a pixel size of 6.5 microns in a
                              
                              12000x1 format. Both the CCD's and the A/D convertors
                              
                              have a dynamic range of 12bits. The data is stored in
                              
                              16bit format. The ADS is a push-broom sensor and the
                              
                              ground footprint of the imagery at NAIP scale is 12km
                              
                              wide by the length flightline. The maximum flightline
                              
                              length is limited to approximately 240km.
                              
                              The factory calibrations and IMU alignments for each
                              
                              sensor (sn30017 8/6/2009, sn30014 5/15/2008 and
                              
                              sn30034 12/7/2007) were tested and verified by in-situ
                              
                              test flights before the start of the project.
                              
                              The Leica ADS Flight Planning and Evaluation Software
                              
                              (FPES) is used to develop the flight acquisition plans.
                              
                              Flight acquisition sub blocks are designed first to
                              
                              define the GNSS base station logistics, and to break
                              
                              the project up into manageable acquisition units. The
                              
                              flight acquisition sub blocks are designed based on
                              
                              the specified acquisition season, native UTM zone of
                              
                              the DOQQs, flight line length limitations (to ensure
                              
                              sufficient performance of the IMU solution) as well
                              
                              as air traffic restrictions in the area. Once the sub
                              
                              blocks have been delineated they are brought into FPES
                              
                              for flight line design. The design parameters used in
                              
                              FPES will be 30% lateral overlap and 1.0m resolution.
                              
                              The flight lines have been designed with a north/south
                              
                              orientation. The design takes into account the
                              
                              latitude of the state, which affects line spacing due
                              
                              to convergence as well as the terrain. SRTM elevation
                              
                              data is used in the FPES design to ensure the 1m GSD
                              
                              is achieved over all types of terrain.
                              
                              The raw data was downloaded from the sensors after
                              
                              each flight using Leica XPro software. The imagery was
                              
                              then georeferenced using the 200Hz GPS/INS data
                              
                              creating an exterior orientation for each scan line
                              
                              (x/y/z/o/p/k). Technicians precisely measured tie
                              
                              points in 3 bands/looks (Back/Nadir/Forward) for each
                              
                              line using Leica Xpro software. The resulting point
                              
                              data and exterior orientation data were used to
                              
                              perform a full bundle adjustment with ORIMA software.
                              
                              Blunders were removed, and additional tie points
                              
                              measured in weak areas to ensure a robust solution.
                              
                              Once the point data was clean and point coverage was
                              
                              acceptable, photo-identifiable GPS-surveyed ground
                              
                              control points were introduced into the block
                              
                              adjustment. The bundle adjustment process produces
                              
                              revised exterior orientation data for the sensor with
                              
                              GPS/INS, datum, and sensor calibration errors modeled
                              
                              and removed. Using the revised exterior orientation
                              
                              from the bundle adjustment, orthorectified image
                              
                              strips were created with Xpro software and the May

                              software applies an atmospheric-BRDF radiometric
                              
                              correction to the imagery. This correction compensates
                              
                              for atmospheric absorption, solar illumination angle
                              
                              and bi-directional reflectance. The orthorectified
                              
                              strips were then overlaid with each other and the
                              
                              ground control to check accuracy. Once the accuracy of
                              
                              the orthorectified image strips were validated the
                              
                              strips were then imported into Inpho's OrthoVista 4.5
                              
                              package which was used for the final radiometric
                              
                              balance, mosaic, and DOQQ sheet creation. The final
                              
                              DOQQ sheets, with a 300m buffer and a ground pixel
                              
                              resolution of 1m were then combined and compressed to
