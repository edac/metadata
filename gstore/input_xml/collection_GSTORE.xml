      <abstract>Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophotoquadrangle (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overedge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points.</abstract>
      <purpose>DOQs serve a variety of purposes, from interim maps to field references for Earth science investigations and analysis.  The DOQ is useful as a layer of a geographic information system and as a tool for revision of digital line graphs and topographic maps.</purpose>
      <supplinfo>DOQQs are available in two formats. The GeoTIFFs are uncompressed files, and due to file size limitations, are not available for downloading from the Resource Geographic Information System Program (RGIS) website. Therefore, they are available only through the custom order process described in the Distribution section of these metadata. The MrSid (.sid) files and/or Enhanced Compressed Wavelet files have been created from the GeoTIFFs and are a 1:40 (.sid) and 1:15 (.ecw) compression of the GeoTIFF file. The compression creates a smaller file size that can be downloaded easily from the RGIS website and is readily available.</supplinfo>

      <logical>All DOQ header data and image file sizes are validated by Tape Validation System (TVS) software prior to archiving in the Sales Data Base. This validation procedure assures correct physical format and field values for header record elements. Logical relationships between header record elements are tested.</logical>
      <completeness>All DOQ images are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacement exists in the image area or in overedge coverage. The DOQ images may be derived by mosaicking multiple images, in order to ensure complete coverage. All DOQs are cloud free. Some clouds may (very infrequently) be encountered only in the overedge coverage. Source photography is leaf-off in deciduous vegetation regions. Void areas may exist, having a radiometric value of zero and appearing black. These voids are areas for which no photographic source is available or are the result of image transformation from other planimetric systems to the UTM projection. In the latter case, the void sliver areas are on the outside edges of the overedge area. The data set field content of each DOQ header record element is validated to assure completeness prior to archiving in the Sales Data Base.</completeness>

         <report>During photographic reproduction of the source photography, limited analog dodging is performed to improve image quality. Analog dodging consists of holding back light from certain areas of the sensitized photographic material to avoid overexposure. The diapositive is inspected to insure clarity and radiometric uniformity. Diapositive image brightness values are collected with a minimum of image quality manipulation. Image brightness values may deviate from brightness values of the original imagery due to image value interpolation during the scanning and rectification processes. Radiometry is verified by visually inspecting the DOQs to the original unrectified image to determine if the DOQ has the same image quality or better image quality than the original unrectified input image.  Slight systematic and radiometric differences can be detected between adjacent DOQ files due primarily to differences in source photography capture dates and Sun angles of aerial photography along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when compared to adjacent DOQ files.</report>

            <explanation>The DOQ root-mean-square-error (RMSE) is the square root of the average of the squared discrepancies. These discrepancies are the differences in coordinate (x and y) values derived by comparing the data being tested with values determined during aerotriangulation or by an independent survey of higher accuracy.</explanation>

      <qual type="horizontal">
         <report>The DOQ horizontal positional accuracy and the assurance of that accuracy depend, in part, on the accuracy of the data inputs to the rectification process. These inputs consist of the digital elevation model (DEM), aerotriangulation control and methods, the photo source camera calibration, scanner calibration, and aerial photographs that meet National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP) standards.  Field control is acquired by third order class 1 or better survey methods sufficiently spaced to meet National Map Accuracy Standards for 1:12,000 scale products. Aerial cameras have current certification from the USGS, National Mapping Division, Optical Science Laboratory. Test calibration scans are performed on all source photography scanners.</report>

         <description>To produce a DOQ requires (1) a minimum of three ground positions that can be identified on the photograph to be rectified, (2) camera calibration parameters, such as the calibrated focal length and the coordinates of the camera fiducials, (3) a digital elevation model (DEM), and (4) a digital image produced by scanning an aerial photograph with a precise, high-resolution scanner.  The digital image is rectified to generate an orthophoto by processing requirements 1 through 3 above for each image picture element (pixel), using rigorous photogrammetric equations on a computer. The finished product is a spatially accurate image with planimetric features represented in their true geographic positions.</description>

      <overview>Each pixel contains an 8-bit gray-scale value between 0 and 255 for DOQs from a panchromatic source. A value of 0 represents the color black, while a value of 255 represents the color white. All values between 0 and 255 are represented as a shade of gray, varying from black to white. For color-infrared and natural color DOQs, a digital number from 0 to 255 also is assigned to each pixel, but that number refers to a color look-up table which contains the red, green, and blue (RGB) values, each from 0 to 255, for that digital number. Areas where the rectification process is incomplete due to incomplete data (e.g., lack of elevation data, gaps), are represented with the numeric value of 0.</overview>
